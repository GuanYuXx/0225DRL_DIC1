# Personal Website Project

## Overview
This is a modern, single-page personal website created for Chen Kuan Yu. It features a sleek, premium design with a dark-mode space aesthetic and a dynamic real-time clock displaying the user's local time.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the page, including the layout and semantic tags.
- `style.css`: The styling file responsible for the visual design, including colors, typography, layout, glow effects, floating blobs, glassmorphic card effects, and responsive adjustments.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript logic that dynamically updates the real-time clock and date display.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Clock**: A dynamically updating and accurate clock using JavaScript that displays the live local time and date.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: A clean design using modern dark mode backgrounds, transparent glassmorphism, floating abstract shapes (blobs), smooth gradients, and glowing effects.
- **Modern Typography**: Integrated the 'Outfit' font from Google Fonts.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly layout that dynamically adjusts text sizing and container padding depending on the screen dimensions.

## Development History
1. Initial creation of the website with inline CSS and JavaScript within a single `index.html` file.
2. Initialized Git repository, configured credentials, and pushed to GitHub.
3. Refactored the codebase by extracting the CSS and JavaScript into separate files (`style.css` and `script.js`) for better maintainability and best practices. Code then pushed to GitHub.
4. Added this `summary.md` document to describe the project.
